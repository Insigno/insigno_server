# insigno_server
Server implemented in c

Instructions:
Use makefile to compile
start server
start client1
write client1 id
start client2 
write client2 id
client1 write client2 id
client2 write client1 id
now the clients should be able to talk to each other with a realy shitty client (and server)

DISCLAIMER: only works on localhost

Stuff to fix:
Need more error handling
Probably allot of concurrenct issues
And lots of other stuff...

Features:
Can connect to different users (only tested locally)

Stuff to do:
Choose mode (chatting, store file, more...)
More user stuff (password, etc..)
NEED TO MAKE PROTOCOLS FOR SENDING STUFF
Send files
Logging?
Need better client preferably a GUI client app
And much much more
